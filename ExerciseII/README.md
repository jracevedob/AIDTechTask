## Task Description ##

In this directory is presented the design of a block diagram to integrate a self-driving car software stack into a central hardware compute platform for a level 4/5 of autonomous driving. In the design are detailed the ports for internal communicaition and memory bandwidths for data transfered. As described in the exercise I, although the autonomous driving software stack can be represented by a complex set of interconnected blocks, it is based on three main design principles: detection, tracking, and location.

In the attached file, the reader can find a detailed description of the hardware software codesing module.
